# Switching to linux Desktop

A little more than a year ago, I moved my main computer from MacOS to Linux.

## Background

When it comes to running Linux on desktop, I think I'm a pretty good candidate. I only really use
two apps - a browser and a terminal - both of which have plenty of options on Linux. I don't use any
proprietary photo or video editing software, I do all of my gaming on a PS5 or my
[playdate](https://play.date/) (this little black-and-white gameboy-like device), and I'm happy to
put in a bit of work to configure my setup. If any of those things weren't true, I might have been
better off staying with my Mac.

## Choosing hardware and software

There's quite a few choices to make when deciding to run Linux on desktop.

The first I encountered was the question of hardware. Some popular options include
[system76](https://system76.com/), [framework](https://frame.work/), or using a more mainstream
option like a [thinkpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad). I really liked the modularity of
the framework line (although I haven't taken advantage of it yet), so I went with a Framework 16
laptop. It's been great, I haven't regretted my choice.

Around the same time, I started thinking about what Linux distro I wanted to run. I came to
conclusion pretty quickly that I wanted a point-release distro - a distro with discrete releases as
opposed to a distro with rolling releases like Arch. I'm okay with using the bleeding edge of
software for some things (i.e. Neovim), but for something as fundamental as a desktop, I really
didn't want it to during an upgrade.
